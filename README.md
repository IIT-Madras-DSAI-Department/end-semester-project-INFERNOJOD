# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Submitted a total of 3 files which are : main.py , algorithms.py , lab_endsem_report.pdf

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

* There are 3 files which are : main.py , algorithms.py , lab_endsem_report.pdf.
* algorithms.py has implementation of 8 different models/methods
* main.py has complete implementation of the best model that I got after hyper-parameter tuning. The training has been done one MNIST.train.csv and tested on MNIST.validation.csv, all the outputs are displayed in the main.py file itself.

---

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Mention all the related instructions for installation of related packages for running your code here.
* usage of random , numpy , pandas, time , math ,collections has been done in the py files .


## ▶️ Running the Code

* just press run and both should run

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* The code is ready to run in the 2 py files, I had used local path for writing codes but have changed it to just MNIST_train.csv and MNIST_validation.csv before submitting.

## You can further add your own sections/titles along with corresponding contents here:

Only in my lab endsem report in section 3 hyperparameter tuning 
there i have wrote "CLICK ON THIS "
tapping on that directs u to my hyper param tuning report which i have on my drive and only the link is pasted in the lab_endsem_report.pdf.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
